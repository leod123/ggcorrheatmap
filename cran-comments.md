## Resubmission
This is a resubmission, with the following changes:

* All T/F changed to TRUE/FALSE in accordance with the review comments.

* The last mention of heatmaps changed to plural in the Description.

* Not a change, but a comment: There are no references linked to the package so the description was otherwise left unchanged.

* Fixed behaviour where too many rows were returned in the plotting data for mixed layouts. This does not change any other behaviour of the package.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

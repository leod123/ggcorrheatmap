\arguments{
\item{x}{Matrix or data frame in wide format containing the columns to correlate against each other or against the columns in \code{y}.}

\item{y}{Optional matrix or data frame in wide format containing columns to correlate with the columns in \code{x}.}

\item{cor_method}{String specifying correlation method to use in the \code{stats::cor()} function. Default is 'pearson'.}

\item{cor_use}{String specifying the \code{use} argument of \code{stats::cor()}, which defines how to deal with missing values. Default is 'everything'.}

\item{cor_in}{Logical indicating if the input data contains correlation values and any correlation computations (including p-values) should be skipped. Default is FALSE.}

\item{high}{Colour to use for the highest value of the colour scale.}

\item{mid}{Colour to use for 0 in the colour scale.}

\item{low}{Colour to use for the lowest value of the colour scale.}

\item{midpoint}{Value for the middle point of the colour scale.}

\item{limits}{Numeric vector of length two for the limits of the colour scale. NULL uses the default.}

\item{bins}{Number of bins to divide the scale into (if continuous values). A 'double' class value uses 'nice.breaks' to put the breaks at nice numbers which may not result
in the specified number of bins. If an integer the number of bins will be prioritised.}

\item{layout}{String specifying the layout of the output heatmap. Possible layouts include
'topleft', 'topright', 'bottomleft', 'bottomright', or the 'whole'/'full' heatmap (default and only possible option if the matrix is asymmetric).
A combination of the first letters of each word also works (i.e. f, w, tl, tr, bl, br).
If layout is of length two with two opposing triangles, a mixed layout will be used. For mixed layouts,
\code{mode} needs a vector of length two (applied in the same order as layout). See details of \code{gghm()} for more information.}

\item{mode}{A string specifying plotting mode. Possible values are \code{heatmap}/\code{hm} for a normal heatmap, a number from 1 to 25 to draw the corresponding shape,
\code{text} to write the cell values instead of filling cells (colour scaling with value), and \code{none} for blank cells.}

\item{include_diag}{Logical indicating if the diagonal cells should be plotted (if the matrix is symmetric).}

\item{na_col}{Colour to use for cells with NA (both main heatmap and annotation).}

\item{na_remove}{Logical indicating if NA values in the heatmap should be omitted (meaning no cell border is drawn). This does not affect how
NAs are handled in the correlation computations, use the \code{cor_use} argument for NA handling in correlation.}

\item{return_data}{Logical indicating if the data used for plotting (i.e. the correlation values and, if computed, clustering and p-values) should be returned.}

\item{col_scale}{Scale to use for cell colours. If NULL (default), a divergent scale is constructed from the \code{high}, \code{mid}, \code{low}, \code{midpoint}, \code{limits}, and \code{bins} arguments.
These arguments are ignored if a \verb{ggplot2::scale_*} function is provided instead. If a string, the corresponding Brewer or Viridis scale is used.
A string with a scale name with "rev_" in the beginning or "_rev" at the end will result in the reversed scale.
In mixed layouts, can also be a list of length two containing the two scales to use.}

\item{col_name}{String to use for the correlation scale. If NULL (default) the text will depend on the correlation method. Can be two values in mixed layouts for dual scales.}

\item{size_range}{Numeric vector of length 2, specifying lower and upper ranges of shape sizes. Ignored if \code{size_scale} is not NULL.}

\item{size_scale}{\verb{ggplot2::scale_size_*} call to use for size scaling if \code{mode} is a number from 1 to 25 (R pch).
The default behaviour (NULL) is to use a continuous scale with the absolute values of the correlation.}

\item{size_name}{String to use for the size scale legend title. Can be two values in mixed layouts for dual scales.}

\item{legend_order}{Integer vector specifying the order of legends (first value is for the first legend, second for the second, etc). The default (NULL) shows all but size legends.
NAs hide the corresponding legends, a single NA hides all. Ignored for \code{ggplot2} scale objects in \code{col_scale} and \code{size_scale}.}

\item{p_values}{Logical indicating if p-values should be calculated. Use with \code{p_thresholds} to mark cells, and/or \code{return_data} to get the p-values in the output data.}

\item{p_adjust}{String specifying the multiple testing adjustment method to use for the p-values (default is "none"). Passed to \code{stats::p.adjust()}.}

\item{p_thresholds}{Named numeric vector specifying p-value thresholds (in ascending order) to mark. The last element must be 1 or higher (to set the upper limit).
Names must be unique, but one element can be left unnamed (by default 1 is unnamed, meaning values between the threshold closest to 1 and 1 are not marked in the plot).
If NULL, no thresholding is done and p-value intervals are not marked with symbols.}

\item{cell_labels}{Logical specifying if the cells should be labelled with the correlation values. Alternatively, a matrix or data frame with the same shape and dimnames as \code{x}
containing values to write in the cells. If mode is \code{text}, the cell label colours will scale with the correlation values and \code{cell_label_col} is ignored.}

\item{cell_label_p}{Logical indicating if, when \code{cell_labels} is \code{TRUE}, p-values should be written instead of correlation values.}

\item{cell_label_col}{Colour to use for cell labels, passed to \code{ggplot2::geom_text()}.}

\item{cell_label_size}{Size of cell labels, used as the \code{size} argument in \code{ggplot2::geom_text()}.}

\item{cell_label_digits}{Number of digits to display when cells are labelled (if numeric values). Default is 2, passed to \code{base::round()}. NULL for no rounding.}

\item{cell_bg_col}{Colour to use for cell backgrounds in modes 'text' and 'none'.}

\item{cell_bg_alpha}{Alpha for cell colours in modes 'text' and 'none'.}

\item{border_col}{Colour of cell borders. If \code{mode} is not a number, \code{border_col} can be set to NA to remove borders completely.}

\item{border_lwd}{Size of cell borders. If \code{mode} is a number, \code{border_col} can be set to 0 to remove borders.}

\item{border_lty}{Line type of cell borders. Either a number or its corresponding name, or a string of length 2, 4, 6, or 8. See 'lty' of \code{graphics::par()} for details.
Not supported for numeric \code{mode}.}

\item{show_names_diag}{Logical indicating if names should be written in the diagonal cells (for symmetric input).}

\item{names_diag_params}{List with named parameters (such as size, angle, etc) passed on to geom_text when writing the column names in the diagonal.}

\item{show_names_x, show_names_y}{Logical indicating if names should be written on the x and y axes. Labels can be customised using \code{ggplot2::theme()} on the output plot.}

\item{names_x_side}{String specifying position of the x axis names ("top" or "bottom").}

\item{names_y_side}{String specifying position of the y axis names ("left" or "right").}

\item{annot_rows_df, annot_cols_df}{Data frame for row and column annotations. The names of the columns in the data must be included,
either as row names or in a column named \code{.names}. Each other column specifies an annotation where the column name
will be used as the annotation name (in the legend and next to the annotation). Numeric columns will use a continuous
colour scale while factor or character columns use discrete scales.}

\item{annot_rows_col, annot_cols_col}{Named list for row and column annotation colour scales. The names should specify which annotation each scale applies to.
Elements can be strings or ggplot2 "Scale" class objects. If a string, it is used as the brewer palette or viridis option.
If a scale object it is used as is, allowing more flexibility. This may change the order that legends are drawn in,
specify order using the \code{guide} argument in the \code{ggplot2} scale function.}

\item{annot_rows_side}{String specifying which side row annotation should be drawn ('left' or 'right', defaults to 'left').}

\item{annot_cols_side}{String specifying which side column annotation should be drawn ('bottom' or 'top', defaults to 'bottom').}

\item{annot_dist}{Distance between heatmap and first annotation cell where 1 is the size of one heatmap cell. Used for both row and column annotation.}

\item{annot_gap}{Distance between each annotation where 1 is the size of one heatmap cell. Used for both row and column annotation.}

\item{annot_size}{Size (width for row annotation, height for column annotation) of annotation cells compared to a heatmap cell. Used for both row and column annotation.}

\item{annot_border_col}{Colour of cell borders in annotation. By default it is the same as \code{border_col} of the main heatmap if it is of length 1, otherwise uses default (grey).}

\item{annot_border_lwd}{Line width of cell borders in annotation. By default it is the same as \code{border_lwd} of the main heatmap if it is of length 1, otherwise uses default (0.5).}

\item{annot_border_lty}{Line type of cell borders in annotation. By default it is the same as \code{border_lty} of the main heatmap if it is of length 1, otherwise uses default (solid).}

\item{annot_na_col}{Colour to use for NA values in annotations. Annotation-specific colour can be set in the ggplot2 scales in
the \verb{annot_*_fill} arguments.}

\item{annot_na_remove}{Logical indicating if NAs in the annotations should be removed (producing empty spaces).}

\item{annot_rows_params, annot_cols_params}{Named list with parameters for row or column annotations to overwrite the defaults set by the \verb{annot_*} arguments, each name corresponding to the \code{*} part
(see details of \code{gghm()} for more information).}

\item{show_annot_names}{Logical controlling if names of annotations should be shown in the drawing area.}

\item{annot_names_size}{Size of annotation names.}

\item{annot_rows_names_side}{String specifying which side the row annotation names should be on. Either "top" or "bottom".}

\item{annot_cols_names_side}{String specifying which side the column annotation names should be on. Either "left" or "right".}

\item{annot_rows_names_params, annot_cols_names_params}{Named list of parameters for row and column annotation names. Given to \code{ggplot2::geom_text()}.}

\item{annot_rows_name_params, annot_cols_name_params}{Deprecated, kept for backward compatibility. Named list of parameters given to \code{grid::textGrob()} for annotation names.}

\item{cluster_rows, cluster_cols}{Logical indicating if rows or columns should be clustered. Can also be \code{hclust} or \code{dendrogram} objects.}

\item{cluster_distance}{String with the distance metric to use for clustering, given to \code{stats::dist()}.}

\item{cluster_method}{String with the clustering method to use, given to \code{stats::hclust()}.}

\item{show_dend_rows, show_dend_cols}{Logical indicating if a dendrogram should be drawn for the rows or columns.}

\item{dend_rows_side}{Which side to draw the row dendrogram on ('left' or 'right', defaults to 'left').}

\item{dend_cols_side}{Which side to draw the column dendrogram on ('bottom' or 'top', defaults to 'bottom').}

\item{dend_col}{Colour to use for dendrogram lines, applied to both row and column dendrograms.}

\item{dend_dist}{Distance from heatmap (or annotation) to leaves of dendrogram, measured in heatmap cells (1 is the size of one cell).}

\item{dend_rows_extend, dend_cols_extend}{Named list or functional sequence for specifying \code{dendextend} functions to apply to the row or column dendrogram. See details of \code{gghm()} and \code{ggcorrhm()} for usage.}

\item{split_rows, split_cols}{Vectors for splitting the rows and columns into facets. Can be a numeric vector shorter than the number of rows/columns to split the heatmap after those indices,
or a vector of the same length as the number of rows/columns containing the facet memberships. In the latter case names can be used to match with rows/columns.
Alternatively, if clustering is applied a single numeric value is accepted for the number of clusters to divide the plot into.}
}
\value{
The correlation heatmap as a \code{ggplot} object.
If \code{return_data} is TRUE the output is a list containing the plot (named 'plot'),
the correlations ('plot_data', with factor columns 'row' and 'col' and a column 'value' containing the cell values),
and the result of the clustering ('row_clustering' and 'col_clustering', if clustered).
If p-values were calculated, two additional columns named 'p_val' and 'p_adj' are included in 'plot_data', containing nominal and adjusted p-values.
If the layout is mixed, an extra factor column named 'layout' is included, showing which triangle each cell belongs to.
}
\description{
Make a correlation heatmap from input matrices. Uses a diverging colour scale centered around 0.
}
\details{
\code{ggcorrhm()} makes it convenient to make correlation heatmaps, taking the input matrix or data frame to visualise the correlations between columns with the \code{gghm()} function.
The input values can either be one matrix or data frame with columns to correlate with each other, or two
matrices or data frames with columns to correlate between the matrices. No rownames are needed, but
if two matrices are provided they should have the same number of rows and the rows should be ordered in a meaningful way
(i.e. same sample/individual/etc in the same row in both).

Row and column names are displayed in the diagonal by default if the correlation matrix is symmetric (only \code{x} is provided or \code{x} and \code{y} are identical).

The colour scale is set to be a diverging gradient around 0, with options to change the \code{low}, \code{mid}, and \code{high} colours, the \code{midpoint}, and the \code{limits} (using the arguments
of the same names). The \code{bins} argument converts the scale to a discrete scale divided into \code{bins} equally distributed bins (if an integer the breaks may be at strange numbers,
if a double the number of bins may be different but the breaks are at nicer numbers). These arguments can be of length two (\code{limits} a list of length two) two apply
to each triangle in a mixed layout (detailed more in the details section of \code{gghm()}). The \code{size_range} argument (for size scales) can also be a list of length two like \code{limits}.

The size scale, used when a numeric cell shape is specified, is set to vary the shape size between 4 and 10 (can be changed with the \code{size_range} argument)
and to transform the values to absolute values (so that both positive and negative correlations are treated equally).
This behaviour can be overwritten by setting \code{size_scale} to another \verb{ggplot2::scale_size_*} function with the desired
arguments, or \code{ggplot2::scale_size()} for no special behaviour. \code{ggplot2::scale_size_area()} also scales with the absolute value,
but only the upper size limit can be set.
When the absolute value transformation is used the legend for sizes loses its meaning (only displaying positive values)
and is therefore set to not be shown if \code{legend_order} is NULL.

For symmetric correlation matrices, the dendrogram customisation arguments \code{dend_rows_extend} and \code{dend_cols_extend} work best with functions that only change the dendrogram
cosmetically such as the colours, linetypes or node shapes. While it is possible to reorder (using e.g. 'rotate', 'ladderize') or prune (using e.g. 'prune'),
anything that changes the structure of the dendrogram may end up looking strange for symmetric matrices if
only applied to one dimension (e.g. the diagonal may not be on the diagonal, triangular or mixed layouts may not work).
The same applies if the \code{cluster_rows} and \code{cluster_cols} arguments are \code{hclust} or \code{dendrogram} objects.

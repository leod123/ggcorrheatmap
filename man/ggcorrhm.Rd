\arguments{
\item{x}{Matrix or data frame in wide format containing the columns to correlate against each other or against the columns in \code{y}.}

\item{y}{Optional matrix or data frame in wide format containing columns to correlate with the columns in \code{x}.}

\item{cor_method}{String specifying correlation method to use in the \code{cor} function. Default is 'pearson'.}

\item{cor_use}{String specifying the \code{use} argument of \code{cor}, which defineshow to deal with missing values. Default is 'everything'.}

\item{high}{Name of the colour to use for the highest value of the colour scale.}

\item{mid}{Name of the colour to use for 0 in the colour scale.}

\item{low}{Name of the colour to use for the lowest value of the colour scale.}

\item{limits}{Correlation limits to plot between.}

\item{bins}{Specify number of bins if the correlation scale should be binned. NULL for a continuous scale.}

\item{fill_name}{String to use for the correlation fill scale. If NULL (default) the text will depend on the correlation method.}

\item{col_name}{String to use for the correlation colour scale. If NULL (default) the text will depend on the correlation method.}

\item{p_values}{Logical indicating if p-values should be calculated. Use with \code{p_thresholds} to mark cells, and/or \code{return_data} to get the p-values in the output data.}

\item{p_adjust}{String specifying the adjustment method to use for the p-values (default is "none").}

\item{p_thresholds}{Named numeric vector specifying p-value thresholds (in ascending order) to mark. The last element must be 1 or higher (to set the upper limit).
Names must be unique, but one element can be left unnamed (by default 1 is unnamed, meaning values between the threshold closest to 1 and 1 are not marked in the plot).}

\item{mode}{A string specifying plotting mode. Possible values are \code{heatmap}/\code{hm} for a normal heatmap, a number from 1 to 25 to draw the corresponding shape,
\code{text} to write the cell values instead of cells (colour scaling with value), and \code{none} for blank cells (used internally).}

\item{layout}{layout String specifying the layout of the output heatmap. Possible layouts include
top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right, or the whole heatmap (default and only possible option if the matrix is asymmetric).
The string should be composedÂ of the vertical position (top or bottom) followed by the horizontal position (left or right), or just 'full' or 'whole' for the full layout.
A combination of the first letters of each word also works (i.e. f, w, tl, tr, bl, br).
If layout is of length two with two opposing triangles, a mixed layout will be used. For mixed layouts,
\code{mode} needs a vector of length two (applied in the same order as layout) and the \verb{cell_label*} and \verb{border_*} arguments can take length two arguments
(vectors or lists). See details for more information.}

\item{include_diag}{Logical indicating if the diagonal cells should be plotted (included either way if the whole matrix is plotted).}

\item{na_remove}{Logical indicating if NA values in the heatmap should be omitted (meaning no cell border is drawn). This does not affect how
NAs are handled in the correlation computations, use the \code{cor_use} argument for NA handling in correlation.}

\item{na_col}{Colour to use cells with NA.}

\item{return_data}{Logical indicating if the data used for plotting (i.e. the correlation values and, if computed, p-values) should be returned.}

\item{show_legend}{Logical vector indicating if main heatmap legends (fill and size) should be shown. If length 1 it is applied to both fill and size legends.
Can be specified in an aesthetic-specific manner using a named vector like \code{c('fill' = TRUE, 'size' = FALSE)}.}

\item{size_range}{Numeric vector of length 2, specifying lower and upper ranges of shape sizes. Ignored if \code{size_scale} is not NULL.}

\item{size_scale}{\verb{ggplot2::scale_size_*} call to use for size scaling if \code{mode} is a number from 1 to 25 (R pch).
The default behaviour (NULL) is to use a continuous scale with the absolute values of the correlation.}

\item{cell_labels}{Logical specifying if the cells should be labelled with the correlation values.}

\item{cell_label_p}{Logical indicating if, when \code{cell_labels} is \code{TRUE}, p-values should be written instead of correlation values.}

\item{cell_label_col}{Colour to use for cell labels.}

\item{cell_label_size}{Size of cell labels, used as the \code{size} argument in \code{ggplot2::geom_text}.}

\item{cell_label_digits}{Number of digits to display when cells are labelled with correlation coefficients. Default is 2, passed to \code{round}.}

\item{border_col}{Colour of cell borders. If \code{mode} is not a number, \code{border_col} can be set to NA to remove borders completely.}

\item{border_lwd}{Size of cell borders. If \code{mode} is a number, \code{border_col} can be set to 0 to remove borders.}

\item{border_lty}{Line type of cell borders. Not supported for numeric \code{mode}.}

\item{names_diag}{Logical indicating if names should be written in the diagonal cells (for a symmetric matrix).}

\item{names_diag_param}{List with named parameters (such as size, angle, etc) passed on to geom_text when writing the column names in the diagonal.}

\item{names_x}{Logical indicating if names should be written on the x axis. Labels can be customised using \code{ggplot2::theme()} on the output plot.}

\item{names_x_side}{String specifying position of the x axis names ("top" or "bottom").}

\item{names_y}{Logical indicating if names should be written on the y axis.}

\item{names_y_side}{String specifying position of the y axis names ("left" or "right").}

\item{annot_rows_df}{Data frame for row annotations. The names of the columns in the data must be included,
either as row names or in a column named \code{.names}. Each other column specifies an annotation where the column name
will be used as the annotation name (in the legend and next to the annotation). Numeric columns will use a continuous
colour scale while factor or character columns use discrete scales.}

\item{annot_cols_df}{Same usage as \code{annot_rows_df} but for column annotation.}

\item{annot_rows_fill}{Named list for row annotation colour scales. The names should specify which annotation each scale applies to.
Elements can be strings or ggplot2 "Scale" class objects. If a string it is used as the brewer palette (categorical annotation) or viridis option (continuous annotation).
If a scale object it is used as is, allowing more flexibility. This may change the order that legends are drawn in,
specify order using the \code{guide} argument in the \code{ggplot2} scale function.}

\item{annot_cols_fill}{Named list used for column annotation colour scales, used like \code{annot_rows_fill}.}

\item{annot_rows_side}{String specifying which side row annotation should be drawn ('left' for left, otherwise right).}

\item{annot_cols_side}{String specifying which side column annotation should be drawn ('bottom', 'down', 'lower' for bottom, otherwise top).}

\item{annot_legend}{Logical indicating if row and column annotations should have legends.}

\item{annot_dist}{Distance between heatmap and first annotation cell where 1 is the size of one heatmap cell. Used for both row and column annotation.}

\item{annot_gap}{Distance between each annotation where 1 is the size of one heatmap cell. Used for both row and column annotation.}

\item{annot_size}{Size (width for row annotation, height for column annotation) of annotation cells. Used for both row and column annotation.}

\item{annot_label}{Logical controlling if names of annotations should be shown in the drawing area.}

\item{annot_border_col}{Colour of cell borders in annotation. Same as \code{border_col} of the main heatmap if it is of length 1, otherwise uses default (grey).}

\item{annot_border_lwd}{Line width of cell borders in annotation. Same as \code{border_lwd} of the main heatmap if it is of length 1, otherwise uses default (0.5).}

\item{annot_border_lty}{Line type of cell borders in annotation. Same as \code{border_lty} of the main heatmap if it is of length 1, otherwise uses default (solid).}

\item{annot_na_col}{Colour to use for NA values in annotations. Annotation-specific colour can be set in the ggplot2 scales in
the \verb{annot_*_fill} arguments.}

\item{annot_na_remove}{Logical indicating if NAs in the annotations should be removed (producing empty spaces).}

\item{annot_rows_params}{Named list with parameters for row annotations to overwrite the defaults set by the \verb{annot_*} arguments, each name corresponding to the \code{*} part
(see details of \code{gghm} for more information).}

\item{annot_cols_params}{Named list with parameters for column annotations, used like \code{annot_rows_params}.}

\item{annot_rows_label_side}{String specifying which side the row annotation labels should be on. Either "top" or "bottom".}

\item{annot_cols_label_side}{String specifying which side the column annotation labels should be on. Either "left" or "right".}

\item{annot_rows_label_params}{Named list of parameters for row annotation labels. Given to \code{grid::textGrob}, see \code{?grid::textGrob} for details. \code{?grid::gpar} is also helpful.}

\item{annot_cols_label_params}{Named list of parameters for column annotation labels. Given to \code{grid::textGrob}, see \code{?grid::textGrob} for details. \code{?grid::gpar} is also helpful.}

\item{cluster_rows}{Logical indicating if rows should be clustered.}

\item{dend_rows}{Logical indicating if a dendrogram should be drawn for the rows.}

\item{dend_cols}{Logical indicating if a dendrogram should be drawn for the columns.}

\item{dend_rows_side}{Which side to draw the row dendrogram on ('left' for left, otherwise right).}

\item{dend_cols_side}{Which side to draw the column dendrogram on ('bottom', 'down', 'lower' for bottom, otherwise top).}

\item{dend_col}{Colour to use for dendrogram lines, applied to both row and column dendrograms.}

\value{
The correlation heatmap as a \code{ggplot} object.
If \code{return_data} is TRUE the output is a list containing the plot (named 'plot'),
the correlations ('plot_data'), and the result of the clustering ('clustering', only if \code{cluster_data} is TRUE).
If p-values were calculated, two additional columns named 'p_val' and 'p_adj' are included, containing nominal and adjusted p-values.
}
\description{
Wrapper function for \code{gghm} to make a correlation heatmap from input matrices. Uses a diverging colour scale centered around 0.
}
\details{
\code{ggcorrhm} is a wrapper function for \code{gghm}, making it convenient to make correlation heatmaps.
The input values can either be one matrix or data frame with columns to correlate with each other, or two
matrices or data frames with columns to correlate between the matrices. No rownames are needed, but
if two matrices are provided they should have the same number of rows and the rows should be ordered in a meaningful way
(i.e. same sample/individual/etc in the same row in both).

Row and column names are displayed in the diagonal by default if the correlation matrix is symmetric (only \code{x} is provided or \code{x} and \code{y} are identical).

The colour scale is set to be a diverging gradient around 0, with options to change the low, mid, and high colours and the limits.
The \code{bins} argument converts the scale to a discrete scale divided into \code{bins} equally distributed bins.

The size scale, used when a numeric cell shape is specified, is set to vary the shape size between 4 and 10 (can be changed with the \code{size_range} argument)
and to transform the values to absolute values (so that both positive and negative correlations are treated equally).
This behaviour can be overwritten by setting \code{size_scale} to another \verb{ggplot2::scale_size_*} function with the desired
arguments, or \code{ggplot2::scale_size()} for no special behaviour.
When the absolute value transformation is used the legend for sizes loses its meaning (only displaying positive values)
and is therefore set to not be shown in the \code{show_legend} argument.
